Fixes & Improvements
1. True Map Visualization

Issue: The current grid layout is not an actual map—it loses the geographic context of where each district is.

Fix:

Replace grid with an interactive map using Leaflet.js or Mapbox GL JS.

Render Texas congressional district GeoJSON from TxDOT’s Open Data Portal.

Users should be able to zoom, pan, and click directly on a district shape to get details.

Keep your “District Information” panel on the right, updating dynamically when a district is clicked.

2. Visual Styling

Current Problem: The solid red/blue blocks are flat and feel outdated.

Fix:

Add soft gradient fills with borders around each district shape.

Use hover glow/highlight effects for interactivity.

Match colors to accessible contrast ratios so red/blue are readable for colorblind users—use patterns or icons in addition to color.

3. District Information Panel

Current Problem: The right panel is functional but feels cramped and static.

Fix:

Add district map preview (small inset map) inside the panel.

Use a clean card layout with section headers (Representative, Party, Population, Area).

If available, add representative photo and contact buttons (email, phone, website).

Include a link to “Bills Sponsored by this Representative” pulling from ProPublica API.

4. Search & Filter

Current Problem: Users can’t quickly jump to their district unless they already know it.

Fix:

Add a search bar for district number or representative name.

Add filters: by party, population range, or representative name.

5. Legend & Usability

Current Problem: Legend is fine, but static and visually bland.

Fix:

Make legend interactive—clicking “Republican” hides/shows Republican districts.

Add hover tooltips in the legend explaining party color codes.

6. Technical Implementation Suggestions

Mapping:

Leaflet.js (lightweight) or Mapbox GL JS (better styling).

Load Texas GeoJSON from:
TxDOT Congressional Districts

Data Integration:

ProPublica Congress API for representative details & bills.

Census API for updated population data.

Styling Framework:

Tailwind CSS for consistent modern styling.
